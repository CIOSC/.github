# CIO Strategy Council
## Transformation through collaboration

The CIO Strategy Council is Canada’s primary national forum bringing together the country’s most forward-thinking chief information officers and executive technology leaders to collectively mobilize on common digital priorities. 

## What We Do

* **STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP** Regular Council meetings are held, and strategic partnerships are fostered to engage thought leaders and experts nation-wide in discussion and collaboration – accelerating research, policy and solution development on key ICT-related issues impacting CIOs and Canadian society at-large.
* **STANDARDS & TECHNOLOGY** Standards are established by the collective and collaborative efforts of the Council to inform the design, set the rules and accelerate technology  adoption. The Standards Council of Canada accredited the CIO Strategy Council to develop National Standards of Canada.
*  **SKILLS AND TALENT** Working together, Council members and its strategic partners provide guidance to help address the challenges and opportunities facing the future of work in order to keep Canada’s ICT talent competitive within the global economy.
